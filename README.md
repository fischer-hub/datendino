# datendino
A small platformer made with the `PHASER` framework. Scores can be saved to a leaderboard that is connected to a `supabase` database. You are playing as the data dino from [CorrelAid](https://www.correlaid.org/), dodge the bars that escaped their bar plots, collect hearts to gain extra lives and beware pascal's triangles! They can be quite sharp!


How far can you make it? Share your score to the leaderboard and see if you can reach significance!
